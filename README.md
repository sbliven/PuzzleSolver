PuzzleSolver
============

This is a tool for dealing with grid-based puzzles like Sudoku and Kenken. While
it does provide some solvers for the puzzles, the focus is more on assisting
human solvers rather than replacing them.

The program contains python classes for representing puzzles and analyzing or
solving them. It also contains a user interface built on [Kivy](kivy.org) and
[OpenCV](opencv.org) for automated and semi-automated board detection from a
camera.
